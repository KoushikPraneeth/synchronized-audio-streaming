What you're describing is essentially creating a synchronized audio streaming solution across multiple devices. Let me break down how you could approach this as a webapp:
Technical Approach

Web Audio Synchronization

Your webapp would need to stream the audio from the source (laptop) to multiple connected devices
Each device would access the webapp through a browser
WebRTC and Web Audio API would be the core technologies to handle the audio streaming

Architecture

Host: The laptop playing the video
Clients: Phones/other devices receiving synchronized audio
The host captures the system audio and broadcasts it to connected clients
Each client plays the audio through their speakers/headphones

Key Components

Audio capture from the system (requires user permission)
WebSocket server for real-time communication
Time synchronization protocol to keep all devices in sync
Client-side buffering to handle network latency

Implementation Considerations
For a webapp version, you could create:

A simple website where the host creates a "room"
Clients join the room by scanning a QR code or entering a code
The host shares their audio, and all clients receive it simultaneously
Simple controls for volume on individual devices

Challenges to Solve

Audio synchronization across devices (the biggest challenge)
Network latency compensation
Browser compatibility (especially on mobile)
Audio quality vs bandwidth requirements

For your specific architecture, you would need:

Next.js as your main framework
Socket.io for WebSocket connections and room management
Web Audio API for audio processing
WebRTC for peer-to-peer audio streaming (if needed)
A lightweight time synchronization protocol (can be implemented with Socket.io)
